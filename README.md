# Manhunt plugin for SpigotMC and PaperMC


**ManhuntPlugin** is a plugin for Minecraft Java Edition that allows you to organize “manhunts” games in your server.


Originally written for Spigot/Bukkit 1.21.4, this fork is already compatible with **PaperMC 1.21.4** and can take advantage of Paper extensions in the future.


## Requirements
- **SpigotMC Server** / **PaperMC Server**
- **Java 17+** (for SpigotMC)
- **Java 22+** (for PaperMC)


## Installation
1. Download the .JAR for your platform,
2. Copy the .JAR to `plugins/`,
3. Start or restart the server. In the console you should see that the plugin is enabled.


## Bugs
If you find any bugs report them in this repository.


## Future updates
1. The plugin will be only updated with small bug fixes and small corrections on the code.
   I'm learning the whole **PaperMC API** so I will make it **PaperMC** exclusive and add some more complex features.
2. I will try to release the plugin for the new versions as fast as possible
